Solo builder & founder learning to build & ship in real time.

AI has made it possible for individuals with the right skills (technical fluency, taste, distribution, dedication) to ship successful products. I’m documenting my attempt to build and make a living whilst the ground moves beneath our feet.

If you're reading this, maybe you're a PM, designer or operator interested in learning how to build, ship and distribute with AI. Hopefully I can provide some value over time learning as I go. Let's see where this takes us... best of luck.
