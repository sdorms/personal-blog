I’m a solo builder documenting experiments in real time.

I’m testing the hypothesis that as the barriers to building software lower, leverage comes from the right balance of technical fluency, judgment, and distribution. Get that balance right, and individuals or small teams can deliver in ways that weren’t realistic before.

If you’re a PM, designer, or operator interested in building and shipping independently, I’m sharing what works, what doesn’t, and how things evolve along the way.
